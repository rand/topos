# Product Guidelines: Topos

## Prose Style & Tone
- **Professional but Approachable:** Documentation and AI-generated content must be technically precise and objective, yet delivered with the clarity and friendliness of a helpful colleague.
- **Precision First:** Avoid fluff. Use exact terminology to reflect the "contract" nature of the language.

## Design Principles
- **Readable over Formal:** Prioritize human readability and intuition over dense mathematical notation. The goal is human verification without specialized training.
- **CommonMark Compatibility:** The syntax must remain a strict superset of CommonMark, ensuring every Topos file is a valid Markdown file that renders correctly in standard viewers.

## Handling Incompleteness
- **Progressive Specification:** Explicitly track unknowns using typed holes `[?]`. This allows for development to proceed while acknowledging where the spec is still maturing.
- **Soft Constraints:** Use `[~]` for aesthetic, subjective, or approximate requirements (e.g., "the UI should feel snappy"). These are treated as meaningful goals even if they aren't binary-pass/fail.

## Visual Identity
- **Technical & Structured:** Leverage monospaced fonts, clean structural diagrams, and clear hierarchies to reflect precision.
- **Modern Developer-Centric:** Focus on high-quality syntax highlighting, dark-mode-first aesthetics, and vibrant accent colors that resonate with modern engineering environments.

## AI Interaction Rules
- **Evidence-Based Completion:** The AI is never "done" until concrete evidence (tests, commits, PRs) is linked to the task.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Encourage the AI to suggest spec refinements (and typed hole resolutions) as it discovers implementation constraints.
- **Strict Context Adherence:** AI operations must be bounded by the focused context generated by the Context Compiler to ensure accuracy and reduce hallucinations.
